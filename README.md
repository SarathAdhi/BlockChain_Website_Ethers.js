# BlocksInfo
- This website is similar to etherscan.io, Where the website allows you to search through transactions, blocks, wallet addresses, smart contracts, and other on-chain data. Using BlocksInfo, enter any Ethereum address into the search box to see the current balance and transaction history of the wallet. No API's from etherscan or other API's are used. All the information's are extracted directly from Blockchain using ethers.js.
